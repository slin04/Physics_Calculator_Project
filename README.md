# My Personal Project

## Physics Calculator

My application will allow users to create physics equations, enter all
**known** parameters, and compute the **unknown** parameter(s) if possible. This 
application will be useful for students that need to solve physics equations quickly.
Note that the program does not actually solve entire problems for students; it simply
allows students that have already determined how to solve the problem to skip tedious
computation and arrive straight to the answer. This project is interest of me because
I am currently taking a physics course and I believe that a program like this would 
allow students to worry less about the computational aspect of problems and focus more on
conceptual aspect.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a new equation to my list of equations.
- As a user, I want to be able to enter the known values for an equation, and either 
receive the value I'm trying to solve for, or a notification that I did not provide 
sufficient information. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire list of equations, and see the status
of each equation.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete any equation from my list of equations.
- As a user, I want to be able to modify the input values for an equation from my list
and see the new result.
